// This code snippet is defining an enumeration type in Java called `StatusType`. An enumeration is a
// special data type that consists of a set of named constants. In this case, the `StatusType` enum has
// three constant values: `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, and `REJECTED`. These constants represent different
// statuses that can be used in the application to indicate the current state of something, such as a
// user's account status or a transaction status. Enums are useful for defining a fixed set of related
// constants and can help improve code readability and maintainability.
public enum StatusType {
    PENDING,
    ACCEPTED,
    REJECTED
}
